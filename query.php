<p> TA: Please do not "TEST" your (especially, complicated) quries in this demo website. The loading of quries might kill the server. 

Also, the machine running this website a has VERY different setting from your virutal machine, for example, the memory size, so testing your quries in this page is meaningless. 

Since we grade your projects in a virtual machine. Please test your queries (especially queries with sub-queries) at your own machine. </p>

Type an SQL query in the following box:

<p>

<form action="." method="GET">

<textarea name="query" cols="60" rows="8"></textarea>

<input type="submit" value="Submit" />

</form>

</p>

<p><small>Note: tables and fields are case sensitive. Run "show tables" to see the list of

available tables.</small>
